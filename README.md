# Installing Jupyter
To install Jupyter please run the following commands:
```
# Ensure pip is up to date
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install jupyter
$ pip3 install jupyter

# Run jupyter
$ jupyter-notebook

```


That will dump out some server status stuff similar to this:
```
[I 09:04:18.118 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /run/user/1000/jupyter/notebook_cookie_secret
[I 09:04:18.316 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/riley/Documents/DataScience
[I 09:04:18.316 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 09:04:18.316 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 09:04:18.316 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=60cff886b3523a69ecbeae781fe6ff1687c369136d7a0204
[I 09:04:18.316 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

At the same time, it should have opened a browser tab with what looks like a file browser. In the top right corner, click `New` this will create a new Jupyter doc. (To run a premade one just select the file in the jupyter file browser.


Congratulations! You have now installed Jupyter NoteBooks
